#### &#8594; VAS-Pre questionnaire: 
* __Complementary Information A:__<br>Boxplots made for the cases where VAS-POS questionnaires were used, carried out after each emotional stimulation (Fear, Happy and Neutral). This information complements Section 5.1.2. 
>     A - Vas-Pos fear 
>Set of 5 figures, each one with 4 graphics. Each graph contains 3 Boxplots (1 per group of participants), that allows a comparison of the percentages (% of anxiety, happy, fear or stress) obtained in the VAS-Pos questionnaire (Session 1) made after fear stimulation, according to the groupings of participants made based on the cluster analysis on the features retained from the EMG, ECG, EDA, STICSA-State questionnaire or STICSA-Trait questionnaire (Session 1). 

>     A - Vas-Pos happy
>Set of 5 figures, each one with 4 graphics. Each graph contains 3 Boxplots (1 per group of participants), that allows a comparison of the percentages (% of anxiety, happy, fear or stress) obtained in the VAS-Pos questionnaire (Session 1) made after happy stimulation, according to the groupings of participants made based on the cluster analysis on the features retained from the EMG, ECG, EDA, STICSA-State questionnaire or STICSA-Trait questionnaire (Session 1). 

>     A - Vas-Pos neutral
>Set of 5 figures, each one with 4 graphics. Each graph contains 3 Boxplots (1 per group of participants), that allows a comparison of the percentages (% of anxiety, happy, fear or stress) obtained in the VAS-Pos questionnaire (Session 1) made after neutral stimulation, according to the groupings of participants made based on the cluster analysis on the features retained from the EMG, ECG, EDA, STICSA-State questionnaire or STICSA-Trait questionnaire (Session 1). 

* __Complementary Information B:__<br>Tables that shows the results of Kruskal-wallis test, One Way ANOVA or Welch's ANOVA, for the case in 
which the VAS-Pos questionnaires are used. This information complements Section 5.1.2. 
>     B - Vas-Pos fear 
>Table with the results of the statistical tests performed on the grouped values of the features anxiety, fear, 
stress and happy obtained in the VAS-Pos questionnaire made after fear stimulation, in order to verify the existence or not of significant 
differences between the groups formed based on the ECG, EDA, EMG signals (collected during fear stimulation), the state 
questionnaire, and the trait questionnaire.

>     B - Vas-Pos happy
>Table with the results of the statistical tests performed on the grouped values of the features anxiety, fear, 
stress and happy obtained in the VAS-Pos questionnaire made after happy stimulation, in order to verify the existence or not of significant 
differences between the groups formed based on the ECG, EDA, EMG signals (collected during happy stimulation), the state 
questionnaire, and the trait questionnaire.

>     B - Vas-Pos neutral
>Table with the results of the statistical tests performed on the grouped values of the features anxiety, fear, 
stress and happy obtained in the VAS-Pos questionnaire made after neutral stimulation, in order to verify the existence or not of significant 
differences between the groups formed based on the ECG, EDA, EMG signals (collected during neutral stimulation), the state 
questionnaire, and the trait questionnaire.

* __Complementary Information C:__<br>Graphs of the results obtained With the optimized constructed model in terms of Recall and Precision. This information complements Section 5.5.1.
